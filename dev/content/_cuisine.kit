            Belizeans of all ethnicities eat a wide variety of foods. Breakfast consists of 
            bread, flour tortillas, journey (johnny in Creole) cakes, or fry jacks that are often 
            homemade. It is eaten with various cheeses (Dutch cheese, band back cheese, craft cheese, 
            etc.) refried beans, various forms of eggs or cereal (corn flakes, oatmeal) sweetened 
            with condensed milk. Morning beverages include milk, coffee, tea, Milo, Ovaltine, Cocoa, 
            orange juice (fresh or concentrated). Eating breakfast is called "drinking tea."

            Midday meals vary, from lighter foods like beans and rice with or without coconut milk, 
            tamales, panades, (fried maize (corn) shells with beans or fish) and meat pies, escabeche 
            (onion soup), chilmole (black soup made with black recardo), stew chicken and garnaches 
            (fried tortillas with beans, cheese, and cabbage sauce) to various constituted dinners featuring 
            some type of rice and beans, meat and salad or coleslaw.

            In the rural areas meals may be more simplified than in the cities. The Maya use recardo, corn or 
            maize for most of their meals, and the Garifuna are fond of fish and other seafood, cassava 
            (particularly made into hudut) and vegetables. Local fruits and certain vegetables are quite 
            common. Mealtime is a communion for families and schools and some businesses close at midday for 
            lunch, reopening later in the afternoon.
