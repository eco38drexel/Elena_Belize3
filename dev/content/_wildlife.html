                Over 500 species of feathered friends call Belize home from time to time. 
                Some of the best places to see migrant and resident water birds are Crooked 
                Tree and the seashores of Belize.

                Like everything else here, you can easily watch birds while doing something 
                else. Going on a zip-lining trip? You may see a toucan. Cruising the Hummingbird 
                Highway to San Ignacio? Pull over and check out a few birds. In the Cockscomb 
                Basin Forest Reserve? So are birds.

                For the adventurous, much of the forest remains unexplored and awaits discovery, 
                but fortunately the casual tourist can enjoy the trails blazed by those who ventured 
                forth before and experience a nature lover's dream come true. Home to jaguars, tapirs 
                and crocodiles, Belizeâ€™s rainforest is a world unto itself, unequalled anywhere else 
                on the planet. Over 500 identified species of birds fly through the rainforest, living 
                in its trees and burrows on the ground. Thousands of plants and tropical flowers grow in 
                the wild, including a staggering 250 types of orchids and 700 species of trees. From wildcats 
                to colorful birds to exotic plants and waterfalls cascading thousands of feet into clear 
                pools, there are many exciting wildlife discoveries for you each and every day.
