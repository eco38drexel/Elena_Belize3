            <h4>Travel Health and Safety</h4>
            <p>
                Ready for your next trip to Belize? We’ve created a new Tourism Gold 
                Standard program to keep you safer from arrival to departure. This extensive 
                program is made specifically for hotels, restaurants, tour operators and other 
                relevant businesses to enhance their health and safety standards. By adapting 
                these new behaviors and procedures, these establishments will be able to ensure 
                the safety of all travellers as they enjoy vacationing in Belize. From the 
                new Belize Health App to enhanced cleanliness protocols for hotels, tour operators, 
                and tourist attractions, we’ve reimagined our travel policies, so you can breathe 
                easy while you explore our curious locations.
