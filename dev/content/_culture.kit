            The Belizean culture is a mix of influences and people from Kriol, Maya, 
            East Indian, Garinagu (also known as Garifuna), Mestizo (a mixture of Spanish 
            and Native Americans), Mennonites who are of German descent, with many other 
            cultures from Chinese to Lebanese. It is a unique blend that emerged through 
            the country's long and occasionally violent history. In Belizean folklore, we 
            find the legends of La Llorona, Cadejo, the Tata Duende, and X'tabai.

            The idea of the mystical healing and Obeah is prominent in Belizean legend, and 
            there is still talk of evil shaman practices like putting "Obeah" on certain houses. 
            This is known to be done by burying a bottle with the 'evil' under a tree close by the house
