								                Over 500 species of feathered friends call Belize home from time to time. 
								                Some of the best places to see migrant and resident water birds are Crooked 
								                Tree and the seashores of Belize.
								
								                Like everything else here, you can easily watch birds while doing something 
								                else. Going on a zip-lining trip? You may see a toucan. Cruising the Hummingbird 
								                Highway to San Ignacio? Pull over and check out a few birds. In the Cockscomb 
								                Basin Forest Reserve? So are birds.

																								    <h2>Culture</h2>
																								    <section>
																								        <p>
																								            The Belizean culture is a mix of influences and people from Kriol, Maya, 
																								            East Indian, Garinagu (also known as Garifuna), Mestizo (a mixture of Spanish 
																								            and Native Americans), Mennonites who are of German descent, with many other 
																								            cultures from Chinese to Lebanese. It is a unique blend that emerged through 
																								            the country's long and occasionally violent history. In Belizean folklore, we 
																								            find the legends of La Llorona, Cadejo, the Tata Duende, and X'tabai.
																								        </p>
																								        <p>
																								            The idea of the mystical healing and Obeah is prominent in Belizean legend, and 
																								            there is still talk of evil shaman practices like putting "Obeah" on certain houses. 
																								            This is known to be done by burying a bottle with the 'evil' under a tree close by the house

																														            Belizeans of all ethnicities eat a wide variety of foods. Breakfast consists of 
																														            bread, flour tortillas, journey (johnny in Creole) cakes, or fry jacks that are often 
																														            homemade. It is eaten with various cheeses (Dutch cheese, band back cheese, craft cheese, 
																														            etc.) refried beans, various forms of eggs or cereal (corn flakes, oatmeal) sweetened 
																														            with condensed milk. Morning beverages include milk, coffee, tea, Milo, Ovaltine, Cocoa, 
																														            orange juice (fresh or concentrated). Eating breakfast is called "drinking tea."

																														            Midday meals vary, from lighter foods like beans and rice with or without coconut milk, 
																														            tamales, panades, (fried maize (corn) shells with beans or fish) and meat pies, escabeche 
																														            (onion soup), chilmole (black soup made with black recardo), stew chicken and garnaches 
																														            (fried tortillas with beans, cheese, and cabbage sauce) to various constituted dinners featuring 
																														            some type of rice and beans, meat and salad or coleslaw.
																														
																														            In the rural areas meals may be more simplified than in the cities. The Maya use recardo, corn or 
																														            maize for most of their meals, and the Garifuna are fond of fish and other seafood, cassava 
																														            (particularly made into hudut) and vegetables. Local fruits and certain vegetables are quite 
																														            common. Mealtime is a communion for families and schools and some businesses close at midday for 
																														            lunch, reopening later in the afternoon.
